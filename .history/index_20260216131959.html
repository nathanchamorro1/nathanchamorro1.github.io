 <h2>Hello World! I'm:</h2>
 <h1>Nathan Chamorro</h1>
 <p>I’m a computer science student at Cal State Fullerton graduating this May, focused on software development, cybersecurity, and design. This site showcases my projects, experience, and more about me as a student. Designed in Figma, built from scratch in Visual Studio Code, and deployed via GitHub Pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (in case you were wondering!).</p>
